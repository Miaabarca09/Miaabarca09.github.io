        <h1>Chile rellenos recipe!</h1>
        <h2>History</h2>
         <p> Puebla nuns made their chili relleno in a walnut sauce (Nogal is the Spanish word for walnut tree) and then sprinkled it with parsley and pomegranate seeds. The result: A vibrant and colorful dish of red, white, and green that has made Chiles en Nogada one of Mexicoâ€™s most patriotic dishes.</p>
